# Prusa-MK2-Ext.-Driver-Board
So, what is this? This is an external stepper driver board for X and Y stepper motors of the original Prusa MK2/MK2S/MK2.5/MK2.5S printers. It allows usage of TMC2100/TMC2208/TMC2209 drivers (Silent Step Stick and similar, (TMC2209 are recommended), so your printer will become a lot quieter and much smoother due to the 256 step interpolation (same as on the MK3). This is the latest upgraded version 2.4 of the board.
